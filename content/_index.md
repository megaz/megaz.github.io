Iâ€™m a technology leader and lifelong software engineer based in London, UK, with a deep interest in software engineering, distributed systems, data engineering, AI, and technical leadership.

I thrive on building and leading high-impact, inclusive engineering teams and love working on challenging, large-scale technical problems.

Mentorship and giving back are also important to me. If youâ€™d like guidance, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn. While I can only mentor a limited number of people at once, Iâ€™ll do my best to accommodate.
