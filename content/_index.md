## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a technology leader and lifelong software engineer based in London, UK, with a deep interest in software engineering, distributed systems, data engineering, AI, and technical leadership.

I thrive on building and leading high-impact, inclusive engineering teams and love working on challenging, large-scale technical problems.

Mentorship and giving back are also important to me. If you'd like guidance, feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/zahirabdi/). While I can only mentor a limited number of people at once, I'll do my best to accommodate.
